						<h2>Project History</h2>
						<p>My interest in financial inclusion reaches back several years to my time in undergraduate studying economics and interning for non-profit in New Orleans which helps entrepreneurs secure 0 interest KIVA loans (Fund 17 does truly great work for the people of New Orleans). However, most of my work with financial inclusion, prior to my current program, was limited to survey work, my internship with Fund 17, and other limited, less quantitatively intense modes.</p>
						<p>Last semester I took a course in GIS (geographic information systems) and was suprised when I found the topic of financial inclusion emerge again, but in the context of spatial statistics. In particular, it occured to me that most conversations in academic literature and in the mainstream media around access to finance for lower socioeconomic communities revolves around the advent of a global digital financial infrastructure. However, something did not sit right with me about the intense focus on digital finance as an all encompassing solution to the financial uninclusion of communities.</p>
						<p>As I thought on the topic more, I realized that my issue with the over emphasis on digital finance was the implication that non-digital payment systems was becoming obselete, which seems off-base for lower socioeconomic communities where cash businesses still thrive. So I formed a question to investigate!</p>
						<h2>Forming The Research Question</h2>
						<p>While digital finance is certainly a positive force in improving financial inclusion (i.e. the percentage of a community that has a bank account and primarily uses traditional banks for financing), it seemed to me that the lowest socioeconomic communities may face barriers associated with a cash economy that were unrelated to the solutions offered by digital finance. For example, if an individual who is paid in the form of a check lives in a neighborhood in which shops tend to accept only cash, but the nearest ATM or bank that can cash the check is miles away, that individual will have to pay extra in the form of time and effort to utilize their income in their own neighborhood.</p>
						<p>So I landed on the following question that best characterized the goal in my mind: Is there a spatial relationship between pysical access to finance and financial inclusion rates?</p>
						<h2>Gathering the Right Data</h2>
						<p>To find the right data to answer this question, I had to answer some questions:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>What does it mean for a person to be financially included and how can I measure that?</li>
						<li>How can I represent a physical network of access points to the financial industry and what is the best way to obtain that data?</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Fortunately, both sets of questions were fairly straightforward to answer! For the measures of financial inclusion, the FDIC provides a strong definition of financial inclusion which they hav emeasured through <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/bank-owned-atm-locations-in-new-york-state"><span>survey</span></a> for several years now, in conjunction with the Census Bureau!</p>
						<p>For physical networks of the financial industry, I had to get a bit more creative. I realized that a cash-heavy economy would still intersect quite often with the non-cash economy. As a result, even folks operating primarily in the cash economy would need some form of access to ATMs. So the challenge was then to find a method of locating ATMs to operationalize the physical network of traditional banks. New York's <a href="https://economicinclusion.gov/"><span>Data.Gov</span></a> website provided a great dataset which did the trick.</p>
						<h2>Processing the Data</h2>
						<p> Before I could get started with the analysis, I had to do a bit more processing of the data. Unfortunately, the FDIC data on financial inclusion provided national and state-level estimates for the U.S., but no estimates for NYC itself. However, I did find a a <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/where-are-unbanked-and-underbanked-new-york-city"><span>paper from 2015</span></a> in which researchers used the same data set from the FDIC and demographic data from the American Community Survey to train a predictive model (ordinal logistic to be specific) and provide predicted estimates of financial inclusion for the communities of NYC!</p>
						<p>Using the researchers' methods, I generated estimates for financial inclusion (I actually updated their estimates using an improved model and more recent data, which I will hopefully write a separate article on later!), and using the RDSTK package in R, I geocoded the addresses for the ATM locations to a format compatable with packages for geospatial analysis. Then I was finally ready to begin analyzing the data.</p>
						<h2>Exploring the Data</h2>
						<p>Before working with any statistical models, I first wanted to know what the dispersion of ATMs looked like and how that related in a visual sense to measures of financial inclusion. To do say, I made use of QGIS and GeoDa (geospatial stats programs) to produce graphics to illuminate the situation. First, I wanted to understand where people without bank accounts lived. From this first graphic, it is clear that folks without bank accounts tend to live in Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as the surrounding communities. The lowest rates of financial uninclusion are clearly in Manhattan, Staten Island, and parts of Queens.</p>
						<li><img src="../images/Unbanked_Rates.png" height="100%" width="100%"></li>
						<p>Next, I wanted to know if ATMs were generally evenly distributed in the city (and thus providing realtively simlar access citywide) or if they clustered in certain locations. The graphic that illuminated the trends in the data best was a significance cluster map, which shows where ATMs cluster in statistically significant ways. The graphic below shows that that ATMs cluster significantly in Manhattan and are absent to a disproportionate degree in parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
						<li><img src="../images/ATMs_Cluster_Significance.png" height="100%" width="100%"></li>
						<p>From the exploration, I was feeling confident that the data would show some form of statistically significant relationship between the physical infrastructure and financial inclusion. So I moved forward with the statistical analysis!</p>
						<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
						<p>I chose to conduct a spatial regression model (correcting for spatial lag, and using a queen's weight matrix for those familiar with geospatial analysis) and added controls for citizenship since immigration status is likely to have a heavy influence on financial inclusion among lower socioeconomic, primarily cash-operated communities.</p>
						<p>The result of the model leads to a mixed conclusion. The coeffiecient showed that a greater number of ATMs was associated with greater financial inclusions, incontrovertibly. In fact the probability of having gotten the estimate produced by the model and it being false was less than 0.0001%. That being said, the effect is quite small with the addition of one ATM being associated with a less than .01% improvement in rate of financial inlcusion. While there are large numbers of ATMs in the communities, the effect is quite clearly smaller than I might have other wise expected.</p>
						<h2>Conclusions and Reflections</h2>
						<p>I found this project quite fun as I was able to get creative with the kinds of data I used and the ways I operationalized variables. Moreover, while the effect was somewhat small, I was intrigued to find that physical infrastructure does matter to some degree in improving financial inclusion, particularly among the poorest communities. It was nice to see some merit to my gut feeling as well. In the future, I will enjoy doing more of these statistical analyses, particularly the graphics as they illuminate so much information in such a natural way. I do believe I will be revisiting these topics/tools soon enough!</p>
