							<h2>A Bit About My Site and Myself:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Welcome to my platform, where I post projects and articles focusing on data visuazlization, analytics, machine learning, geospatial analysis, and other data-oriented topics. Below you will find small articles in which I investigate topics of personal interest. My goal in posting my projects is two-fold. First, I enjoy telling stories using data and I hope that I might inspire some creativity in others who come across my work. Second, I use this site to hold myself accountable in my committment to constantly build my skills in data science.</p>
						<p>For a little background on me, I am originally from southeastern Louisiana. I graduated from Tulane University in 2018 with a degree in Economics & Political Science as well as minors in Math & Arabic (it was quite rough managing all of them!). I then spent some time working in economic research as well as communications before moving to the Big Apple to pursue a master's in Quantitative Methods. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in New York and even found a place to watch LSU games (shoutout to Legend's!). I am now actively searching for work as a data scientist and am continuing to build my skills in the interim. Please feel free to drop me a note if you find anything here interesting!</p>
